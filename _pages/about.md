I am a PhD student at ETH Zürich and I am highly passionate about the field of machine learning applied to drug discovery, chemistry and biomedical research. 

As of September 2019 I joined the group of [Gisbert Schneider](https://cadd.ethz.ch/people/gisbert_Schneider.html) as a PhD student, working on machine learning for drug discovery. This includes the application of SO(3)-equivariant point convolution networks, language models and ab initio first principles calculations of electronic properties. 

Previously, I obtained a M.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Basel, where I worked with [Sebastian Hiller](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/researchgroups/overview/unit/hiller/research-group-prof-sebastian-hiller/) and [Daniel Häussinger](https://haeussinger.chemie.unibas.ch/en/home/) on NMR spectroscopy, and with [Anatole von Lilienfeld](https://www.chemie1.unibas.ch/~anatole/index.html) on quantum-based machine learning. Furthermore, I had the chance to complete the [Roche internship in medicinal chemistry](https://www.roche.com/careers/our-locations/europe/switzerland/ch-your-job/students_and_graduates/ch_internships/rich_program.htm), where I worked with Dr Uwe Grether on chemical probes targeting the endocannabinoid system.

### Personal

I was born and grew up in the beautiful city of Basel. Before attending the University there, I was an apprentice with Peter Mohr at Roche, working on drug discovery for cardiovascular diseases. 

My hobbies include photography, traveling, art and architecture. To my favorite museums count the [Fondation Beyler](https://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/) in Riehen and the [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern) in London. The later was built by [Jacques Herzog and Pierre De Meuron](https://www.vitra.com/de-ch/corporation/designer/details/herzog-de-meuron), most likely the two most influential Swiss architects. I additionally like festivals, swimming in the Rhein and running.
