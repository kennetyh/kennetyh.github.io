I am a PhD student at ETH Zürich and I am highly passionate about the field of machine learning applied to drug discovery, chemistry and biomedical research. 

As of September 2019 I joined ETH Zürich as a PhD student under the supervision of [Gisbert Schneider](https://cadd.ethz.ch/people/gisbert_Schneider.html) working on machine learning for drug discovery. This includes the application of E3-equivariant point convolution networks, language models and ab initio first principles calculations of electronic properties. 

Previously, I obtained a M.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Basel, where I worked with [Sebastian Hiller](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/researchgroups/overview/unit/hiller/research-group-prof-sebastian-hiller/) and [Daniel Häussinger](https://haeussinger.chemie.unibas.ch/en/home/) on NMR spectroscopy, and with [Anatole von Lilienfeld](https://www.chemie1.unibas.ch/~anatole/index.html) on quantum-based machine learning. Furthermore, I had the chance to complete the [Roche internship in medicinal chemistry](https://www.roche.com/careers/our-locations/europe/switzerland/ch-your-job/students_and_graduates/ch_internships/rich_program.htm), where I worked with Dr Uwe Grether on chemical probes targeting the endocannabinoid system.

### Personal

I was born and grew up in the beautiful city of Basel. Before attending the University there, I was an apprentice with Dr Peter Mohr at Roche, working on drug discovery for cardiovascular diseases. 

Besides research, my hobbies include photography, traveling, surfing, festivals, swimming in the Rhein, running and German as well as English literature.
