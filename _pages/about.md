I am a PhD student at ETH Zürich and I am highly passionate about the field of machine learning applied to drug discovery, chemistry and biomedical research. I obtained my M.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Basel, where I worked with [Prof Sebastian Hiller](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/research/researchgroups/overview/unit/hiller/research-group-prof-sebastian-hiller/) (Structural Biology with NMR), [Prof Anatole von Lilienfeld](https://www.chemie1.unibas.ch/~anatole/index.html) (Quantum-based Machine Learning) and [Dr Daniel Häussinger](https://haeussinger.chemie.unibas.ch/en/home/) (NMR of small-molecules). Furthermore I had the chance to spend 9 months at [Roche](https://www.roche.com/research_and_development/who_we_are_how_we_work/our_structure/pred.htm) with Dr Uwe Grether working on chemical probes targeting for endocannabinoid system. I am critically thinking, open-minded, resilient, and strive to challenge the status quo.

As of September 2019 I joined ETH Zürich as a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof Gisbert Schneider](https://cadd.ethz.ch/people/gisbert_Schneider.html) working on machine learning for drug discovery. This includes the application of E3-equivariant point convolution networks, language models and ab initio first principles calculations of electronic properties.

### A bit more personal

I was born and grew up in the beautiful city of Basel. Before attending the University there, I was an apprentice with Dr Peter Mohr at Roche, working on drug discovery for cardiovascular diseases. 

Besides research, my hobbies include photography, traveling, surfing, festivals, swimming in the Rhein, running and German as well as English literature.
